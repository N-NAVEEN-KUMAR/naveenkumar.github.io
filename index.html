  <!-- ABOUT -->
  <section class="content reveal">
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Telco Cloud Engineer with hands-on experience operating
      production OpenStack environments. My work focuses on Linux
      troubleshooting, infrastructure reliability, and incident
      resolution in systems where downtime is unacceptable.
    </p>
    <p>
      I work close to the system — from the operating system layer
      to cloud services — and I enjoy understanding how failures
      happen and how to prevent them.
    </p>

  <!-- EXPERIENCE -->
  <section class="content reveal">
    <h2>Engineering Work</h2>
    <p>
      I have worked on automating OpenStack cluster health checks
      to reduce manual effort and improve early detection of failures.
      I regularly troubleshoot VM connectivity and performance issues
      by analyzing logs, services, and network paths.
    </p>
    <p>
      My approach is systematic: observe symptoms, isolate the layer,
      verify assumptions, and fix the root cause.

  <!-- GROWTH -->
  <section class="content reveal">
    <h2>Growth</h2>
    <p>
      I am continuously deepening my understanding of OpenStack,
      RHOSP concepts, Linux internals, and cloud architecture.
      My long-term goal is to design and operate resilient systems
      at hyperscale.
